Rock, paper, scissors program. 

(This is a slightly cleaned up and improved version from the one submitted last week)

To run, type in “./rps <choice>”, typing in either ‘r’, ’s’ or ‘p’ where it says <choice>

To run tests just write ./rps

‘r’ is rock
’s’ is scissors
‘p’ is paper

Typing in another value will provide an error.
