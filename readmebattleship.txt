Battleship program:

This program is a 9x9 battleship board with only two available ships (ship of length 4 horizontally orientated and ship of length 3 vertically orientated)

./battleship runs tests
./battleship 1 or 2 allows you to play the game

There is no GUI as I wasn’t sure how to make one without showing the other player’s choices

The actual playing of the game works to an extent although it is a bit buggy.
